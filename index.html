        <p class="flex-auto p-2 ml-4 text-xs"><span class="text-yellow-400">Hi!</span> This webpage was designed to glorify my accomplishments in an attempt to woo you. I subtly try to highlight the significance of my life & my work and argue that my birth has changed the course of humanity.</p>
        
        <p class="flex-auto p-2"> These days I'm taking a side project way too seriously. Before this, I was working on Reinforcement Learning (RL) <span id='research' class="text-purple-700">research^</span>. I got a chance to work with some really <a class="text-red-400" href="https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/">cool</a> <a class="text-yellow-400" href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/">people</a>. Before RL, I was doing some sort of Machine Learning (ML) research. I was studying at NITW then. I was &#128577 then. Anyway, Before ML, I worked on web/app development. <span class="text-xs">Showing off a bit here but... </span>I met Woz in highschool! He is super cool. And super nice. That's something we can all learn from him. I'm trying to. That meeting was the highlight of my life. It's been all downhill from there. Anyway. I did some electronics back then. I think I've forgotten most of it. Before all of this nerdy shit, I used to make memes and dance in front of laundry stores. I don't think I am capable of dancing now.</p>
